# **MarketNest: E-commerce Platform**

**MarketNest** is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience while following a **microservices architecture**. This platform is built using **Spring Boot** for backend microservices and **React** for the frontend. The decoupled architecture ensures flexibility, scalability, and modularity. The system supports features like product browsing, cart management, secure payments, and administrative controls.

## **Features**

### **User Features**
1. **User Authentication**:
   - **Registration**: New users can register with email and password.
   - **Login**: Users log in to receive a **JWT token** for secure, stateless authentication.
   - **Role-based Access**: Users access product listings and cart management. Admins have extended permissions to manage products, orders, and users.

2. **Product Management**:
   - Browse products with filtering, sorting, and searching options.
   - View detailed product pages (images, price, description, and stock status).
   - Add products to the shopping cart with quantity options.

3. **Shopping Cart**:
   - Manage items in the cart (update quantities, remove items).
   - Checkout process with shipping details.
   - Receive order confirmation and tracking details after successful transactions.

4. **Order Management**:
   - View order history, status, and invoices.

### **Admin Features**
1. **Product Management**:
   - Add, update, or delete products.
   - Categorize products for easier browsing.

2. **Order Management**:
   - View all orders and update their status (pending, shipped, delivered).
   - Track sales metrics and generate performance reports.

3. **User Management**:
   - View, activate, or ban user accounts.

### **Payment Integration**
- **Stripe** or **PayPal** for secure payment processing.

### **Responsive Design**
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Microservices Architecture**

**MarketNest** will be designed using the following microservices:

1. **Authentication Service**:
   - Manages user registration, login, and JWT issuance.
   - Uses Spring Security for role-based access.

2. **Product Service**:
   - Handles product catalog, filtering, searching, and category management.
   - Exposes APIs for product retrieval and updates.

3. **Cart Service**:
   - Manages cart-related operations such as adding/removing items and calculating totals.

4. **Order Service**:
   - Handles order placement, status tracking, and order history.

5. **Payment Service**:
   - Integrates with third-party payment gateways for secure transactions.

6. **Admin Service**:
   - Provides admin-specific operations like user and product management.

7. **API Gateway**:
   - Acts as a single entry point, routing requests to the appropriate services.
   - Handles security, rate-limiting, and request validation.

8. **Configuration Service**:
   - Centralized configuration management for all microservices using **Spring Cloud Config**.

9. **Discovery Service**:
   - Service discovery and registration using **Eureka**.

10. **Notification Service** (optional):
    - Sends order confirmations and updates via email or SMS.

## **How We Are Going to Build It**

### **Version Control with Git and GitHub**
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code.
  - `develop`: Integration branch for all features.
  - `feature/*`: Feature-specific branches.
  - `hotfix/*`: For urgent production fixes.
- **Pull Requests**: All feature branches will be merged via pull requests with code reviews.
- **Commit Messages**: Clear and consistent format, e.g., `Add: Payment gateway integration`.

### **Containerization with Docker**
- Each microservice will be containerized using **Docker**.
- **Docker Compose** will manage multi-container setups in development.
- Each microservice will have its own `Dockerfile` to ensure isolation and portability.

### **Service Communication**
- Services will communicate through **REST APIs** and **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous messaging (e.g., order updates, notifications).

### **API Gateway**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** will be used to route client requests to the appropriate microservices.

### **Database Design**
- Each service will have its own database to ensure loose coupling.
  - **Authentication Service**: User credentials and roles.
  - **Product Service**: Product catalog and categories.
  - **Cart Service**: Temporary cart data.
  - **Order Service**: Order details and history.
  - **Payment Service**: Transaction records.
- **PostgreSQL** will be used as the primary database, with services designed to handle distributed transactions if necessary.

### **Authentication**
- Stateless authentication using **JWT** tokens issued by the **Authentication Service**.
- Token validation will be handled at the API Gateway and by individual services.

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **GitHub Actions** will automate:
  - **Build**: Each microservice will be built and tested independently.
  - **Testing**: Unit and integration tests will run for all services.
  - **Deployment**: Merged code will be deployed to staging/production using **Docker**.
- Deployment will target cloud platforms like **AWS ECS**, **Kubernetes**, or **Heroku**.

### **Service Monitoring**
- **Spring Boot Actuator** will provide health and metrics endpoints for all microservices.
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** will be used for real-time monitoring and visualization.
